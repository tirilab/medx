# MedX: Medication Regimen Complexity Calculation Python Package

### Overview

[MedX](https://github.com/tirilab/medx) is a python package developed by Translational Informatics @ Johns Hopkins University.

Understanding medication regimen complexity is important to understand what patients may benefit from pharmacist interventions.
Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI), a 65-item tool to quantify the complexity by incorporating the number, dosage form, frequency, and special administration instructions of prescription medicines, provides a more nuanced way of assessing complexity. 

MedX package aims to automate the calculation of MRCI and Medication Count from raw EHR data. 
A sample of EHR pseudodata can be found [here](https://github.com/tirilab/medx/blob/release/1.0/tests/sample_data/sample_med.csv).
