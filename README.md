# MedX: Medication Regimen Complexity Calculation Python Package

### Overview

[MedX](https://github.com/tirilab/medx) is a Python package intended to transform longitudinal prescription data from the electronic health record (EHR) into patient-level medication regimen complexity metrics.

Understanding medication regimen complexity is important to understand what patients may benefit from pharmacist interventions.

MedX can take patient-level EHR data as input and then for each patient, calculate two medication complexity metrics: Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) score[1] and Medication Count.

The study team pilot-tested MedX with data collected in the ALIGN (Aligning Medications with What Matters Most) study.[2]

A sample of EHR pseudodata can be found [here](https://github.com/tirilab/medx/blob/release/1.0/tests/sample_data/sample_med.csv).

### Dependencies and Requiorements of Medx:
* Python >= 3.6
* Pandas
